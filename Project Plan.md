## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Objectives
<!-- Establish objectives or goals that the project aims to achieve. -->
1. **Develop Data Analysis and Visualization Tool** \
Create a tool that allows data analysis and visualization for both good and nutritional information, which enables user to gain insight into various foods' nutritional content.
2. **Advanced Food Filtering** \
Provide users the ability to filter foods based on minimum and maximum nutritional values or by predefined nutritional content levels.
3. **Facilitate Dietary Needs** \
Streamline the diet-planning process by providing feature that allow users to filter foods based on specific dietary needs.

### 1.2 Project Stakeholders
<!-- Identify all key stakeholders involved in the project, including internal teams and potential end-users. -->
1. **Project Sponsor**\
Project sponsor ensures that the project aligns with the company's vision, goals, and strategy.
2. **Project Manager**\
The project manager manages the overall process, ensuring that the project is completed on timw while achieving all the main objectives.
3. **Software Developers and UI/UX Designers**\
Software developers and UI/UX designers ensure smooth development and implementation of the tool in order to minimize technical issues.
4. **Nutrisionist and Dietitians**\
As the dataset provided for this project comes from an external source, it is crucial to get opinions from certified nutritionists and dietitians to ensure the accuracy of the database.\
They are also one of the end-users as they can utilize the tool to analyze and visualize nutritional information for various foods.
5. **Regulatory Bodies**\
Ensures that the project and tool comply with relevant regulations and standards, such as FDA guidelines.
6. **Individuals with Dietary Needs**\
Users that have specific diets, due to reason such as disease, allergies, or personal preferences, can use the tool to track their nutritional intake and make informed food choices.
7. **Caregivers**\
Caregivers can use the tool to ensure that the meals they prepare for their patients meet the nutritional requirements.
8. **Chefs**\
Chefs can utilize the tool to create or plan meals with specific nutritional goals in mind.

### 1.3 Project Scope
<!-- Define and manage what is included or excluded in the project and product. -->
- Ensure that the project and tool complies with the relevant regulations and standards.
- Ensure that the tool have all of the required functionalities before the deadline..
- Design and develop a user-friendly interface in order to enhance the overall user experience.
- Cost modelling, breakdown of costings for implementation and maintenance, and customer support are out of this project's scope.

## 2. Work Breakdown Structure

Include the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for the entire project. WBS should be presented as a hierarchical diagram. Use the elements from the WBS to define activities in Section 3, and schedule these activities in the Gantt Chart in Section 4. Ensure all project activities are considered and included in the WBS.

## 3. Activity Definition Estimation

Define the activities required for your project based on the WBS, and assign responsibilities to team members. Each activity should be numbered and correspond with your Gantt chart. Provide estimated durations for each activity to facilitate Gantt chart preparation.
