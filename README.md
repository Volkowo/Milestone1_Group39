# Milestone1_Group39

## Assignment Overview
The overall goal of the group project is to develop a simple data analysis and visualisation tool for the provided database below. Your team will need to design (in Milestone 1) and implement (in Milestone 2) this tool, which must provide a graphical user interface for handling the analysis and visualisation of the data. The dataset includes specific features that your user interface must enable a user to perform.

## Database and Required Features
### Required Features
1. Name: Food Search\
Description: Enable users to search for foods by name and display all the nutritional information;
2. Name: Nutrition Breakdown\
Description: Enable users to select one food, and display pie charts & bar graphs showing the breakdown of different nutrients for the selected food.
3. Name: Nutrition Range Filter\
Description: Enable users to select one of nutrition and input minimum & maximum values, and the tool will display a list of foods that fall within those ranges.
4. Name: Nutrition Level Filter\
Description: Enable users to filter foods by nutritional content levels—low, mid, and high—including fat, protein, carbohydrates, sugar, and nutritional density. The three levels are defined as follows:
Low: Less than 33% of the highest value.
Mid: Between 33% and 66% of the highest value.
High: Greater than 66% of the highest value.
5. Additional feature: you will need to come up with an appropriate feature for analysing and visualising this dataset.\

Description: ?

### Database
The Comprehensive Nutritional Food Database provides detailed nutritional information for a wide range of food items commonly consumed around the world. Column Descriptions in this dataset are listed below. Each of these columns provides critical data that can help in understanding the nutritional content of various foods, supporting a wide range of dietary, health, and medical research applications.
- Food: The name or type of the food item.
- Caloric Value: Total energy provided by the food, typically measured in kilocalories (kcal) per 100 grams.
- Fat( in g): Total amount of fats in grams per 100 grams, including the breakdowns that follow.
- Saturated Fats( in g): Amount of saturated fats (fats that typically raise the level of cholesterol in the blood) in grams per 100 grams.
- Monounsaturated Fats( in g): Amount of monounsaturated fats (considered  heart-healthy fats) in grams per 100 grams.
- Polyunsaturated Fats( in g): Amount of polyunsaturated fats (include essential fats your body needs but can't produce itself) in grams per 100 grams.
- Carbohydrates( in g): Total carbohydrates in grams per 100 grams, including sugars.
- Sugars( in g): Total sugars in grams per 100 grams, a subset of carbohydrates.
- Protein( in g): Total proteins in grams per 100 grams, essential for body repair and growth.
- Dietary Fiber( in g): Fiber content in grams per 100 grams, important for digestive health.
- Cholesterol( in mg): Cholesterol content in milligrams per 100 grams, pertinent for cardiovascular health.
- Sodium( in g): Sodium content in milligrams per 100 grams, crucial for fluid balance and nerve function.
- Water( in g): Water content in grams per 100 grams, which affects the food’s energy density.
- Vitamin A( in mg): Amount of Vitamin A in micrograms per 100 grams, important for vision and immune functioning.
- Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)( in mg): Essential for glucose metabolism.
- Vitamin B11 (Folic Acid)( in mg): Crucial for cell function and tissue growth, particularly important in pregnancy.
- Vitamin B12( in mg): Important for brain function and blood formation.
- Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)( in mg): Necessary for energy production, cell function, and fat metabolism.
- Vitamin B3 (Niacin)( in mg): Supports digestive system, skin, and nerves health.
- Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid)( in mg): Necessary for making blood cells, and helps convert food into energy.
- Vitamin B6( in mg): Important for normal brain development and keeping the nervous and immune systems healthy.
- Vitamin C( in mg): Important for the repair of all body tissues.
- Vitamin D( in mg): Crucial for the absorption of calcium, promoting bone growth and health.
- Vitamin E( in mg): Acts as an antioxidant, helping to protect cells from the damage caused by free radicals.
- Vitamin K( in mg): Necessary for blood clotting and bone health.
- Calcium( in mg): Vital for building and maintaining strong bones and teeth.
- Copper( in mg): Helps with the formation of collagen, increases the absorption of iron and plays a role in energy production.
- Iron( in mg): Essential for the creation of red blood cells.
- Magnesium( in mg): Important for many processes in the body including regulation of muscle and nerve function, blood sugar levels, and blood pressure and making protein, bone, and DNA.
- Manganese( in mg): Involved in the formation of bones, blood clotting factors, and enzymes that play a role in fat and carbohydrate metabolism, calcium absorption, and blood sugar regulation.
- Phosphorus( in mg): Helps with the formation of bones and teeth and is necessary for the body to make protein for the growth, maintenance, and repair of cells and tissues.
- Potassium( in mg): Helps regulate fluid balance, muscle contractions, and nerve signals.
- Selenium( in mg): Important for reproduction, thyroid gland function, DNA production, and protecting the body from damage caused by free radicals and from infection.
- Zinc( in mg): Necessary for the immune system to properly function and plays a role in cell division, cell growth, wound healing, and the breakdown of carbohydrates.
- Nutrition Density: A metric indicating the nutrient richness of the food per calorie.
